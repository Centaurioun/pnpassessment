# SharePoint Syntex adoption assessment

[SharePoint Syntex](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/enterprise/sharepoint-syntex-overview) uses advanced AI and machine teaching to amplify human expertise, automate content processing, and transform content into knowledge. It does so in three areas:

- **Content understanding**: Create AI models that capture expertise to classify and extract information and automatically apply metadata.
- **Content processing**: Automate the capture, ingestion, and categorization of content and streamline content-centric processes.
- **Content compliance**: Connect and manage content to improve security and compliance.

The SharePoint Syntex features bring a ton of added value in the content management space, but how do you know which sites in your tenant can truly benefit from the value that SharePoint Syntex brings? Tenants can have thousands of sites and manually assessing them is not an easy task. Using the SharePoint Syntex adoption module of the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool this assessment is done for you: after [running an assessment](assess.md) you can generate a [Power BI report](report-intro.md) that will explain to you where using SharePoint Syntex will add value to your organization.
