# Running an assessment

Once you've [downloaded](download.md) the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool, [configured authentication](setupauth.md) and [setup optional environment configuration](configuration.md) you're now ready to run your an assessment. A typical assessment will contain these steps:

- [Start](assess-start.md) the assessment
- [Stay informed](assess-operations.md) about the assessment status
- Optionally [Pause/restart](assess-operations.md) the running assessment
- [Generate a report](assess-report.md) containing the assessment details
- [Stop](assess-stop.md) the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool

You'll use the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool CLI (command line interface) for above steps, checkout the linked pages for more details on each step.

## Microsoft 365 Assessment tool CLI

To use the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool you'll need to use the command line interface (CLI) and that can be done in two modes.

### Launch without command line arguments

In this mode the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool CLI will be started and then allows you to keep adding providing commands like `List`, `Start`, `Status` and more.

Here you specify the needed command and optionally it's arguments as part of the command line when you execute the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool.
