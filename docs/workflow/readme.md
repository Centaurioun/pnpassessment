# SharePoint 2013 Workflow Assessment

SharePoint 2013 Workflows platform was introduced 10 years ago. Since the release of SharePoint workflows, Microsoft has evolved workflow orchestration to not only encompass SharePoint, but all the productivity services you use with Microsoft 365 and extend to 3rd parties. Power Automate is the Microsoft solution for workflow orchestration.  It connects to all Microsoft 365 services and over 220 other services to let an enterprise build custom workflows. There are also many 3rd party solutions that can directly orchestrate SharePoint data via SharePointâ€™s open API platform. 
ShaPoint 2010 Workflows was retired as of November 1st 2020 and it's strongly recommended to also consider moving your 2013 workflows to the Power Automate platform or other modern workflow orchestration solutions. 
The new Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool helps you identify and evaluate the SharePoint 2013 workflows on your tenant by providing you the [usage data of SharePoint Workflow 2013](assess.md), and generating a [Power BI report](report-intro.md) that you can use to better plan for migration to a modern workflow orchestration service.
